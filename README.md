this is hosting in localhost. 
This is used for an online app. But it comes some problems when doing on line deployment. So I upload this localhost version
if you are interested.
If you want it to run, you need to download an PostgreSQL and create a database called postgresDB and two tables (users and login) as what I did. You do not need to change setting in js file if you are using default.
After that, using command line type npm start to check its functionality.
